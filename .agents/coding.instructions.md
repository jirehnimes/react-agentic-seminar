# Typescript

1. Use `type` only instead of `interface`.
2. Types should have a `T` prefix (e.g. `TUser`, `TProduct`).

# React Components

1. Use functional components with hooks instead of class components.
2. Component names should be in PascalCase.
3. All components should be exported as named exports except Next.js pages which should be default exports.
